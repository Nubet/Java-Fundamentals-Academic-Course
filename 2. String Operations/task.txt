2) String Operations

Write a program that takes two numbers (a and b) and a string as command-line arguments. The program should extract a substring from the given string starting at index a (inclusive) and ending at index b (exclusive).

Example:
java Substring Welcome 2 4
This should output: elc
The program should then display the original string without the extracted substring. For the given example, it should output: Wome

Guidelines:

    Consider and list all possible incorrect ways of providing arguments.
    Any sequence of parameters other than two natural numbers and a string, where the first number is less than the second and both are less than the length of the string, should generate a precise error message explaining why the parameter set is incorrect.
