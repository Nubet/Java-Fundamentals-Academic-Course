7) Exceptions

Write a program that asks for vectors (mathematical sense) as input. The end of the vector is marked by the enter key. Ignore non-numeric elements. Try to add vectors if their lengths are equal.

Example input:

    A,5,8 - length is 2
    1,9,10a,11 - length is 3
    2,3,5,6,$% - length is 4

If the vector lengths were not equal, throw a `DifferentVectorsLengthsException` (you'll need to create this exception)with which you can specify and later (after catching the exception) read the length of the vectors.
If vectors were equal, the result of the addition is displayed.
If the vectors were n't equal, you should be able to formulate each of the example sentences without changing your code nothing more than catch clause:

    (first, second, ..., last) the vector length is ...
    (first, second, ..., last) the vector length is (lower/bigger) than (first, second, ..., last) vector length. 

The tutor will give the exact sentence to display during evaluation.
Finally, If the vectors were not equal prompt the user to re-enter the vectors.

Guidelines:

    Propose a class and method structure where an exception is thrown in one class/method and caught in another class/method.
    The catching class/method should not have access to any variables of the first class.
    The given example sentences must be formulated solely based on the data read from the exception object. 





JEDYNA POPRAWNA WERSJA, INNE NIE SA AKCEPTOWANE:

public class DifferentVectorsLengthsException extends Exception 
{
    private final Vector[] vectors;

    public Vector[] getVectors() 
    {
        return vectors;
    }
    
    public DifferentVectorsLengthsException()
    {
        super();
        vectors = null;
    }

    public DifferentVectorsLengthsException(String message, Vector []vectors) 
    {
        super(message);
        this.vectors = vectors;
    }
}
