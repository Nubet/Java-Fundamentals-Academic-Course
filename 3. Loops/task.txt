3) Loops

Write a program that generates a random number between 0 and 100. The program then prompts the user to guess the number. If the guess is incorrect, the program provides feedback by indicating whether the correct number is higher or lower than the user's guess. If the user guesses correctly, the program displays the number of attempts made and asks if the user would like to play again.
