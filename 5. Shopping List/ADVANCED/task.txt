5) Shopping List

Write a program for creating a shopping list in text mode. The program reads a text file containing product categories and their items:

Example File:

    Groceries:
        Bread
        Butter
        Milk
        Cheese
    Cleaning Supplies:
        Soap
        Dishwashing liquid
    Automotive:
        Air freshener
        Windshield washer fluid

The product list file is prepared by the user and not modified by the program. Consider using CSV format.

Program Features:

    Load the product list from the file.
    Allow adding products by selecting a category and item.
    Display all products on the shopping list.
    Remove specific products by category and item.
    Save the shopping list to disk.

User Experience: Provide clear instructions and menus for easy use.
Guidelines: Explore the differences between java.io and java.nio packages for file operations.
