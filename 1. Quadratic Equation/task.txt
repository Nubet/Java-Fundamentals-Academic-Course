1) Quadratic Equation

Write a program that solves the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0. The coefficients a, b, and c are passed as command-line arguments. Consider the case where the user provides an incorrect number of parameters.

Guidelines:

    Assume that a, b, and c are integers.
    Consult the Integer class API and find suitable functions.
    Learn the differences between Integer and int.
